## Brief explanation and previews on Mari Belajar project

### Python Instructions
- Make sure data is loaded in the g-drive that is mounted to the Python Notebook
- Run the preprocessing python notebook first
- Then run the RF & LM python notebook
- Then run the vanilla Linear Regression notebook 

**IMPORTANT**: In the dataset folder, there is the FY21_Encoded which is the one hot encoded data with selected features. Within the Python Notebook, you can also see conclusive statements about the code and the project in general. 

### Power BI 

ALL Power BI visualizations are in pbix files.

Why is the FY20 a report instead of a dashboard?
- Since the dashboard is used for the LATEST data, which is FY21. And the structure and pipeline of the dashboards are both applicable. 
- Nevertheless, the dashboard for FY20 is seen through this link: https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/dashboards/8566d17e-9725-4053-8dd7-97301bf3552f?ctid=d7b95ec4-9a7f-4260-b2e3-eb53f0ac8401&pbi_source=linkShare (Only see-able by supervisor and assistant)
